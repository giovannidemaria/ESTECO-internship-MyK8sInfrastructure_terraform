# Simple Kubernetes infrastructure using Terraform and Cloud Build

The project, which was done for the internship at [ESTECO S.p.A.](https://www.esteco.com/) is based on some tutorials using the Infrastructure as Code process.
In particular the following resources have been used:
* [Managing infrastructure as code with Terraform, Cloud Build, and GitOps](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/resource-management/managing-infrastructure-as-code)
* [Provision a GKE Cluster (Google Cloud)](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/kubernetes/gke)
* [Manage Kubernetes Resources via Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-provider)
